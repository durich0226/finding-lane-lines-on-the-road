# finding-lane-lines-on-the-road
Project 1

In this project, Python3 and OpenCV are used to detect the lane lines on the road. The procedure for this project is as following:

    1) transformation to grayscale
    
    2) image smoothing using Gaussian filter
    
    3) edge detection using Canny detector
    
    3) adding yellow lanes to edges image
    
    4) excluding everything out of region of interest's polygon
    
    5) applying hough transformation
    
    6) combining initial image with results
